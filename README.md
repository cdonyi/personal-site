[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f32d4958-d00f-4409-9036-80f64612159c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/timdunklee/deploys)

My personal site that was created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I know... Gatsby is overkill and I should probably use something simpler like [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), but I wanted to experiment with Gatsby. This site is always my playground so it changes on a fairly regular basis. Maybe I'll move to 11ty next, or maybe [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) just for kicks...
